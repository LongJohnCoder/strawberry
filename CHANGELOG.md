## [Unreleased]

## [v1.4] - New runtime stats system

This release contains several major fixes. The operating system is stable with new runtime stat calculation.

-  Written simple cache interface
- Added UART driver package
- Added HID mouse support with special windows software
- Lists completely independent of the scheduler. Faster access.
- Atomic read -  modify - write support
- Reorganization of kernel files
- Combined tcb and the thread stack to reduce fragmentation
- Improvement on scheduler
- Runtime stats independent of reschedule, thus 64-bit time support

- Added license on all files
- Applications can now be programmed via the BlackOS programmer [here]
